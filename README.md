## 2020

This year, I am trying to solve the problem with [Shiika](https://github.com/yhara/shiika), my original programming language.

Shiika lacks many features now but I could managed to solve some of the problem.

## Important notice

I've added many features to Shiika while solving the problems, so early solutions may have redundant code or even does not work with the latest shiika. I'll fix it once all the problems are solved.
